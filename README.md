PLEASE NOTE THIS IS __NOT A VIEWBOT....... 


it was made as a chat moderation/message recall tool for multichannel bots

Dependancies: python 2.7
a now functioning (as far as i know) lurking(anon) __chat logging bot system for Twitch....__

Be sure to check joinlist.py to set the channels you wish to watch.
CLICKMETOSTART will load a bot for every channel in joinlist, if you wish to only load one instance : if lurkbotclass is run directly it will join one bot to the first channel in joinlist...
Btw, it uses folders as part of its operation, so good idea to put it within its own folder to avoid confusion.
enjoy :) 

plan to add: improved file to query the chat db...
improvements to cluttering of dbs and files by making folders to contain them
